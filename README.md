# Remplate

Remplate is a simple template for a React project. It uses Webpack, Babel, and React with hot reloading.

## Should You Use This?

No. This is a template for my own personal use. It's not meant to be used by anyone else.
If you want to use it, go ahead, but I make no guarantees that it will work for you.

## Motivation

I'm petty and I **HATE** vite. So I reverted to use Webpack and Babel. I can use them the way I want to use them and i dont mind
waiting a few extra seconds for the build to finish since this will mostly be used for personal projects so i dont care about the build time.
